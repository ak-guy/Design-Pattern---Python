Design Pattern are typically split into three categories

1. Creational Pattern:
    -> deals with the creation(construction) of objects

2. Structural Pattern:
    -> concerned with the structure (eg. class members)
    -> Many pattern are wappers that mimic the underlying class interface
    -> stress the importance of good API design

3. Behavioral Pattern:
    -> They are all different; no central theme
